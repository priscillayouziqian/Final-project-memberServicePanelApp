## Optimizations
I would like to add a feature to throw an exemption handler for the login function, for username not exist and password incorrect. For further development, add another exemption
handler for creating a password, including password must contain at least one Capital letter, etc.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned Java and how to build backend using DAO design pattern. I learned to add put method using fetch (last time I use axios). 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:<br><br>
